# Business Taxes Documentation Overview
The Revenue Online Service (ROS) enables customers to submit forms electronically to Revenue. These forms are XML files which are signed digitally by a customers digital certificate and transferred securely to ROS. Customers may generate valid XML files, either by using ROS directly or by using third party software packages.

In order to aid third party development, a list of available forms is published here. This page provides developers with an XSD file for each form, as well as a PDF document which explains the various elements of the XML. XSD files can be used to ensure that the XML generated by third party software, conforms to the correct format.
